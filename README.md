# ChatGPTTradingBot :star:
This is my ChatGPT Trading bot, a Node.js project that uses the Alpaca Trade API for trading activities. When a live news event is released via Alpaca, it will ask ChatGpt whther this news
event will have a positive or negative effect on the company stock. Based on that logic it will either BUY or SELL the stock.
